# Data-Analysis-Project

For this project, I have cleaned, prepared, analyzed, and visualized 4 years of food and beverage sales data. The csv files for sales data can be downloaded from the "CSV Files" folder.

I have used PowerBI for this specific project. PowerBI is a fantastic visualization tool that comes with additional tools such as Power Query and DAX, which are very useful when it comes to cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing the data. PowerBI file can be downloaded from the "PowerBI file" folder. 

Note: *You might need to install the Desktop version of PowerBI to open the .pbix file*.

### Country Matrix Dashboard

This interactive report also allows you to "drill-through" each country to get more details of that country's specific sales and products.

Here is how you can drill-through a specific country:

1. On the "Revenue Summary" page, navigate to the world map.
2. You will notice green and red bubbles representing each country (bubbles are green if the total sales for the specific country and chosen period are more than $100000 and red if the total sales are less than $100000).
3. Find the country that you would like more details on (you can hover your mouse over a bubble and the country name will be displayed).
4. Right-click on the bubble, and then hover your mouse over the "Drill through" option.
5. Click on "Main Summary 3 (matrix by country)", as shown in the below picture:

6. You will now be taken to the "By Country" section of the report, where you can see more details regarding the sales information of that specific country.

Note: *You can repeat the above process to drill-through any other country on the "Revenue Summary" page.*
